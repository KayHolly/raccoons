 <p> Participants race down the 200-yard  long hill chasing a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese. 
    It is uncertain when the tradition first began, and is possibly much older than its earliest known 
    written attestation in 1826. The event has a long tradition, held by the people of the village, 
    but now people from a wide range of countries take part in the competition as well. </p>
