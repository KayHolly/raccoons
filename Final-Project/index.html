          <h3>What is the Cheese-Rolling Race?</h3>
        <p>
          Every spring, a little hill in Gloucestershire, England transforms
          into the world’s most delightfully unhinged sporting arena. Welcome to
          the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where the goal is simple:
          chase a nine-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a
          ridiculously steep hill... and try not to break any bones on the way
          down. Competitors from around the globe—ranging from trained athletes
          to brave (or slightly bonkers) amateurs—fling themselves down the
          200-yard slope after the runaway cheese, which can reach speeds up to
          70 mph. Spoiler alert: you’re not catching the cheese. But the first
          person to cross the finish line wins it, along with eternal bragging
          rights and possibly a few bruises. Spectators come for the chaos, the
          camaraderie, and the sheer absurdity of it all. It’s muddy, it’s
          messy, it’s slightly mad—and that’s exactly why it’s legendary. Part
          tradition, part adrenaline rush, and 100% British eccentricity, the
          Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling is not for the faint of heart—but it's
          unforgettable for everyone involved.

        <h3>Is it dangerous?</h3>
        <p>
          Oh, dangerous? No, not at all—just a bunch of people hurling
          themselves down a near-vertical hill after a speeding wheel of cheese.
          What could possibly go wrong? Broken bones, dislocated joints,
          concussions? Mere souvenirs! It’s basically a gentle stroll—if that
          stroll involved gravity doing unspeakable things to your body. Totally
          safe. Bring grandma. <br>(yes it is dangerous, no one has died though)

      <h3>Do I chase the cheese?</h3>
    <p>
      Technically, no. But then you'd just be watching a wheel of cheese roll down a hill without the thrill of personal injury. Where's the fun in that?

    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
  <p>
    Something you don’t mind never wearing again. Bonus points if it’s aerodynamic and mud-resistant.

    <h3>Where can I sign up?</h3>
  <p>
    Sign up <a href="waiver.html">Here</a>! <br> First, sign the waiver (because launching yourself down a hill after cheese might be a touch hazardous), and you’re good to go! Just bring your courage—and maybe a helmet.
